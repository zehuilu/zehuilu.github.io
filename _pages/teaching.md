- <b>AAE 203: Aeromechanics I</b>, Spring 2025   <br/>
Role: Instructor<br/>
Info: undergraduate course (∼ 90 students), Purdue University<br/>
Teaching Evaluation:
  * Overall: Mean (3.51/5), Median (4/5), Response Rate (83/91, 91.21%)
  * Featured Student Comments:
    - The instructor does a good job or answering the questions of students.
    - The instructor is very good at explaining the concepts and knows what he is doing. I hope he continues to just show the details of each problem done.
    - I really appreciate how you can tell that he read and reflected on the mid-course evaluations. The class has improved since then.
    - I hope that Professor Lu continues to stop and ask students if they have any questions.
    - Dr. Lu cares about his students' success in the class, communicates online well and consistently, and tries to include all students so that they have opportunities to succeed, even if it takes considerable effort of his own.
    - I think that Professor Lu does a great job of bring enthusiasm to each lecture and he is looking to help the students who ask questions in his class.
    - I believe that the professor keeps the best ineterests of his students in mind and tries to answer any questions that the students may have about course material. Going over practice problems and examples from the lecture notes, past homeworks, and exams have been incredibly helpful while preparing for this course.
    - Professor Lu always offered for students to come to office hours to answer any questions and always stayed after class to answer questions as well, which I thought was very helpful. He was always willing to help students.
    - Professor Lu does a lot of examples which is helpful. He also does a great job asking if students have questions. He also goes over some homework problems which is nice.
    - He has done a great job communicating with students online and answering questions quickly, which has helped to prevent confusion.

- <b>AAE 364: Control Systems Analysis</b>, Spring 2025   <br/>
Role: Instructor<br/>
Info: undergraduate course (∼ 60 students), Purdue University<br/>
Teaching Evaluation:
  * Overall: Mean (3.67/5), Median (4/5), Response Rate (58/62, 93.55%)
  * Featured Student Comments:
    - He is good about answering questions and directing the students to the right place when they are not understanding something. I also really liked how he would help explain the homework.
    - Very responsive to emails and showed that he cared about the student's success
    - The course has good documentation. The lectures are well organized by week and there is lecture slides.
    - The use of examples presented in lecture is very useful for developing understand. I also appreciated the combination of MATLAB examples and chalkboard examples, as the chalkboard presented hand-done examples while the MATLAB gave us computer examples.
    - The exams were designed interestingly, it was cool to see problems with real world applications, and I would hope this is continued.
    - I appreciate the mixture of both using a slideshow as well as further explaining concepts on the chalkboard and going through examples during lecture. It is a good way to keep students more engaged, instead of just showing us the slideshow alone which we could just look at on our own time.
    - Professor Lu always makes time for questions and tries to ensure that everyone is on the same page.
    - Lu makes time to go over homework in class, and helps us review for the exam. Homework is graded fairly.
    - Professor Lu seems to care about the success of his students and is a great professor.
    - I really appreciated how professor Lu would walk through some of the homework problems during class. The introductions to the homeworks were very helpful to understand the premise of certain homework questions.

- <b>AAE 364: Control Systems Analysis</b>, Fall 2024   <br/>
Role: Instructor<br/>
Info: undergraduate course (∼ 60 students), Purdue University<br/>
Teaching Evaluation:
  * Overall: Mean (3.57/5), Median (4/5), Standard Deviation (1.15), Response Rate (51/59, 86.44%)
  * Featured Student Comments:
    - Every once in a while Lu will provide an example of how the course content is applied in the real world, some of which are actually aerospace engineering examples. These comments greatly increase course engagement, and I hope that real and applicable examples are embedded into the actual course content after this semester.
    - Professor Lu clearly prioritizes his students' wellbeing and wants his students to be well prepared. He consistently asks for student feedback and genuinely implements these changes to improve his teaching. He is also always available to answer questions on Piazza and the like, which is genuinely appreciated.
    - The professor is good about reviewing over homework questions if students need help. The class is organized and if the professor sees that students needed help on a topic that should have been taught in the prerequisite class, still willing to help.
    - Dr. Lu genuinely values making a connection to real world application. While I think this could be further executed through example problems, he often shows youtube videos or papers at the beginning of the class to connect the concept to real world applications. He also works hard to make time for students in office hours or in scheduling meetings. Was more than willing to meet with me to work through how to better succeed in the course
    - I really enjoyed Professor Lu. He made the topics interesting by giving real world examples and great explanations into how these problems. Professor Lu was able to answer students questions and he took time to go through the textbook and highlight key points. I would recommend other undergraduate students to take Professor Lu.
    - Professor Lu is very helpful during office hours and answers all the questions well and is very patient.
    - The focus on more examples rather than only theory is welcomed.
    - Professor Lu always takes the time to answer any questions students have and explains concepts in an intuitive way. There are several occasions where he gave real-life examples to explain how a concept is used in practice, which I hope he continues to do in the future.
    - I personally enjoy Professor Lu's approach to the lecture format, and it made the course very straightforward this semester. Professor Lu was extraordinarily helpful answering questions that students have, and was more than willing to sit after class and take as much time as necessary to explain concepts in more detail. The exams were straightforward, and the course was truly dedicated to getting students comfortable with understanding the concepts through homework assignments and preparing students for exams.
    - Lu did a great job at answer students questions and was always happy to send additional resources that he made or that he found online from other sources to help students. Also, he encouraged the further learning of students and was happy to answer their questions about more advanced topics.
