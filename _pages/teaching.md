- <b>AAE 364: Control Systems Analysis</b>, Fall 2024   <br/>
Role: Instructor<br/>
Info: undergraduate course (∼ 60 students), Purdue University<br/>
Teaching Evaluation:
  * Overall: Mean (3.57/5), Median (4/5), Standard Deviation (1.15), Response Rate (51/59, 86.44%)
  * Featured Student Comments:
    - Every once in a while Lu will provide an example of how the course content is applied in the real world, some of which are actually aerospace engineering examples. These comments greatly increase course engagement, and I hope that real and applicable examples are embedded into the actual course content after this semester.
    - Professor Lu clearly prioritizes his students' wellbeing and wants his students to be well prepared. He consistently asks for student feedback and genuinely implements these changes to improve his teaching. He is also always available to answer questions on Piazza and the like, which is genuinely appreciated.
    - The professor is good about reviewing over homework questions if students need help. The class is organized and if the professor sees that students needed help on a topic that should have been taught in the prerequisite class, still willing to help.
    - Dr. Lu genuinely values making a connection to real world application. While I think this could be further executed through example problems, he often shows youtube videos or papers at the beginning of the class to connect the concept to real world applications. He also works hard to make time for students in office hours or in scheduling meetings. Was more than willing to meet with me to work through how to better succeed in the course
    - I really enjoyed Professor Lu. He made the topics interesting by giving real world examples and great explanations into how these problems. Professor Lu was able to answer students questions and he took time to go through the textbook and highlight key points. I would recommend other undergraduate students to take Professor Lu.
    - Professor Lu is very helpful during office hours and answers all the questions well and is very patient.
    - The focus on more examples rather than only theory is welcomed.
    - Professor Lu always takes the time to answer any questions students have and explains concepts in an intuitive way. There are several occasions where he gave real-life examples to explain how a concept is used in practice, which I hope he continues to do in the future.
    - I personally enjoy Professor Lu's approach to the lecture format, and it made the course very straightforward this semester. Professor Lu was extraordinarily helpful answering questions that students have, and was more than willing to sit after class and take as much time as necessary to explain concepts in more detail. The exams were straightforward, and the course was truly dedicated to getting students comfortable with understanding the concepts through homework assignments and preparing students for exams.
    - Lu did a great job at answer students questions and was always happy to send additional resources that he made or that he found online from other sources to help students. Also, he encouraged the further learning of students and was happy to answer their questions about more advanced topics.
