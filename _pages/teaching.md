- <b>AAE 364: Control Systems Analysis</b>, Fall 2024   <br/>
Role: Instructor<br/>
Info: undergraduate course (∼ 60 students), Purdue University<br/>
Teaching Evaluation:
  * Overall: Mean (3.57/5), Median (4/5), Standard Deviation (1.15), Response Rate (51/59, 86.44%)
  * Featured Student Comments:
    - Every once in a while Lu will provide an example of how the course content is applied in the real world, some of which are actually aerospace engineering examples. These comments greatly increase course engagement, and I hope that real and applicable examples are embedded into the actual course content after this semester.
